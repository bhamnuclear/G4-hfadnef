		7Li(p,n) GEANT4 Simulation for UOB HF-ADNEF
     =========================================================
	Imports .stl files for target and rooms and generates neutrons
	using brumlit code (embedded into PrimaryGenerator)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

change to build directory, delete any existing CMakeCache.txt and CMakeFiles/ (I'll get around to automatically removing these at some point, I promise), then do cmake ..;make

To run the visual mode do: ./adnef
To run batch mode do: ./adnef run1.mac

Change the proton energy and number of neutrons in the run1.mac file

Works in multi-threaded GEANT, writing the outputs from each thread to a .root file with the thread number in the file.
These can be merged with standard ROOT hadd
